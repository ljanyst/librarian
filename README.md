Librarian
=========

This is one of my random-hacking toy projects. It is supposed to do content
indexing. It's not very useful and probably never will be.

indexer
-------
Parses text files and adds their content to an index.

query_processor
---------------
Executes queries on an index. It's possible to search for single words and
construct more complex queries using AND, OR and NOT operators as well as
brackets.

libLibrarian
------------
A library providing API for the fucntionality of the above utilities.
